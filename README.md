## xraytools.py
Various tools for x-ray calculations
* Dependency: [xraylib](https://github.com/tschoonj/xraylib), numpy, scipy, matplotlib
    * Maybe easier to install via [Anaconda](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/xraylib)
* f1f2_EPDL97.dat & f1f2_Windt.dat: Atomic scattering factor data. "EPDL97" is the default.
* f2d_photon: Fluence to dose coversion factor for photons.

## web
Webpage tools for x-ray analysis (under construction)
* shield11: Web version SHIELD11 code for high energy electron shielding
* sr_sheet: Synchrotron radiation calculator
* transmission_solid: Calculate transmission through solid materials
